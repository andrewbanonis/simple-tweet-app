# About

This is a simple Python application I made as practice to better understand Python :)

You are free to modify or almost do whatever you wish with the source code, but just give me credit if you republish it somewhere.

# Instructions

In order for this to work be sure to also get your API keys from https://developer.twitter.com/ and make sure that you have `tweepy` installed.
